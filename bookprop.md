## Summary


“First, it was the machines. They put them in studios and created an industry. Now the young filmmakers are reclaiming the camera for the individual. To them it is an artist's tool. Through it, they see us in a new way. With it, they are creating a revolution in the way we see. Artist and audience, we are all a film generation,”  announced the narrator on WNET, New York's non-commercial educational public television station.  Directed by acclaimed documentarians Edward Pincus and David Newman, *The Way We See It* (1969) was commissioned to explain a national phenomenon: the unprecedented use  of 16mm film by youth in film workshops to make visible their struggles, aspirations and protests.   While Alfonso Pagan and Luis Vale compared the garbage accumulating on New York City’s streets to the  filth of heroin,  John Earl reenacted a life threatening confrontation with a white shop keeper exposing the hazards of daily life under Jim Crow. And as youth filmed on the streets of major cities such as New York and Philadelphia, Hollywood’s most prominent actor of color, Sidney Poitier, secured funding from the American Film Institute and Ford Foundation to fund a new organization aptly titled the Community Film Workshop Council. An important question then follows: why did community organizers and Hollywood’s elite advocate for and open film workshops throughout the country in the 1960s?

That question forms the basis of *In Local Hands*. The answer draws on understanding the critical role film played during the era.   Moving images could be as easily be a tool for control over expression and representation as a mechanism for containment and to silence. As the struggle for civil rights persisted, activists understood that to be invisible or disparaged visually impacted how they and other minorities were treated in other facets of life.  Activists sought to revive efforts to challenge the overwhelming whiteness of moving image culture that rendered large swaths of America either visible through racialized and gendered stereotypes or invisible.  

 In *In Local Hands* , I explore an emerging multi-generational and multi-racial strategy - the film workshop - to wrangle control of moving image culture from the hands of Hollywood and corporate entities. The strategy produced a  practice and cultural logic that I call participatory media.
